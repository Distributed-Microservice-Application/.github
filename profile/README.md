# Distributed Microservice Application

This project demonstrates a reliable microservice architecture that's built to scale. It features asynchronous messaging with Apache Kafka, guaranteed delivery using the Outbox Pattern, and a complete monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana for full visibility into the system.

## üåü Core Concepts

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services are decoupled and communicate asynchronously via Kafka, enhancing scalability and resilience.
- **Guaranteed Message Delivery**: The **Outbox Pattern** combined with **Change Data Capture (CDC)** using **Debezium** ensures that messages are never lost, even if messaging systems are temporarily down.
- **Observability**: Gain deep insights into system behavior with real-time metrics, logs, and beautiful dashboards.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale horizontally. Service A runs with multiple instances, load-balanced by Nginx.

## üöÄ Architecture Flow

The system is designed to reliably calculate the sum of two numbers and maintain a running total, even under load.

1.  **üë§ User Interaction (gRPC & HTTP Request)**
    *   A user (or a K6 load test script) sends a request to the **Nginx Load Balancer**.
    *   gRPC requests are routed to `service-a` on port `50051`.
    *   HTTP requests are routed to `service-a` on port `8090`.

2.  **üß† Service A (Go)**
    *   Receives the request and calculates the sum.
    *   **Outbox Pattern**: Instead of publishing directly to Kafka, it atomically saves the result to an `outbox` table in its own PostgreSQL database. This guarantees the operation is recorded.

3.  **‚ö° Debezium & Kafka Connect**
    *   **Debezium**, a Change Data Capture (CDC) platform, monitors the `outbox` table.
    *   When a new record appears, Debezium captures this change and publishes it as a message to an **Apache Kafka** topic (`user-events`).

4.  **üîÅ Kafka - The Reliable Messenger**
    *   Acts as the central nervous system, decoupling Service A from Service B. It queues the result messages for asynchronous processing.

5.  **üßÆ Service B (Java/Spring Boot)**
    *   Consumes messages from the Kafka topic.
    *   For each message, it updates a running total in its own dedicated PostgreSQL databases (Leader/Replica pattern).

6.  **üìä Observability Stack**
    *   **Prometheus**: Scrapes and stores time-series metrics data.
    *   **Grafana**: Visualizes the collected metrics on pre-configured, real-time dashboards.

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: Included with Docker Desktop. For Linux, [install the plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **make**: A build automation tool.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Distributed-Microservice-Application
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Docker Compose directory:**
    ```sh

    ```

3.  **Start all services:**
    This command will start all containers, including Kafka, databases, and services, in detached mode.
    ```sh
    make start
    ```

4.  **Set up the Debezium Connector:**
    After the services are up, deploy the Debezium connector to start the Change Data Capture process.
    ```sh
    make setup-debezium
    ```
    You can verify its status with `make check-debezium`.

## ‚ö° Load Testing

This project uses **K6** to simulate realistic load scenarios and test system performance.

- **Service A (HTTP)**: The test script is located at `Service-A/internal/test/k6_http.js`.
- **Service B (HTTP)**: The test script is located at `Service-B/k6_http.js`.

**To run a test:**

1.  [Install K6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).
2.  Navigate to the service directory and run the script.

    **Example for Service A:**
    ```sh
    cd Service-A
    k6 run internal/test/k6_http.js
    ```

## üß© Services Breakdown

### Service A (Go)

- **Role**: Accepts gRPC and HTTP requests, calculates a sum, and writes the result to a PostgreSQL `outbox` table.
- **Technology**: Go, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Kafka producer (via Debezium).
- **Key Feature**: Implements the Outbox Pattern to ensure message durability and at-least-once delivery.

### Service B (Java)

- **Role**: Consumes messages from Kafka, adds the result to a running total, and persists it.
- **Technology**: Java, Spring Boot, Kafka Consumer, PostgreSQL.
- **Key Feature**: Maintains a real-time aggregate of results, providing a consistent view of the data via a REST API. It uses a Leader/Replica database pattern for read/write separation.
